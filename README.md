Search & Replace Domain Names in the Database For WP Migrations

The program is written and maintained by
http://interconnectit.com/products/search-and-replace-for-wordpress-databases/

it's undergoing some breakthrough changes in version 3, and it is not wokring in my local environment. So, I think it's better to keep a copy of the old and stable version 2, which has been working fine and has saved me lots of time. It is also being recommaned on the official WP blog: http://codex.wordpress.org/Moving_WordPress

## Usage

1. Download the repo
2. Place `searchreplacedb2.php` to your web root (eg. the same folder as `wp-config.php`)
3. Browse to the `searchreplacedb2.php` in your web browser
4. Fill in the fields as needed
5. Make sure ONLY replace the domain in wp_posts table
